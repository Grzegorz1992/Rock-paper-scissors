# ROCK - PAPER - SCISSORS

## This is my version of the game from Frontend Mentor - Rock, Paper, Scissors

### Technologies I used

1.HTML5
2.CSS
3.JavaScript
4.Vite


### Description

- The game is very simple: choose rock, paper, or scissors and wait for the computer choice!
-  In my project, I made several changes compared to the Frontend Mentor template:
  1. expanding the results table, making the competition much more intense
  2. The results are saved in LocalStorage, so you can come back to the game whenever you want, and your score will remain unchanged
  3. I also added the possibility of a draw in the game
